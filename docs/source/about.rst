Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM)
====================================

Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the process of estimating the
energy consumed by individual appliances given just a whole-house power
meter reading. In other words, it produces an (estimated) itemised
energy bill from just a single, whole-house power meter.

NILM is sometimes called:

-  "non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NALM or NIALM)"
-  "[electriciy \| energy \| smart meter] disaggregation"

Below is an illustration (produced using nilmtk) of what NILM, in
general, can do.

Why a toolkit for NILM?
=======================

We quote our `nilmtk paper <http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.3878v1.pdf>`__
explaining the need for a NILM toolkit.

    Empirically comparing disaggregation algorithms is currently
    virtually impossible. This is due to the different data sets used,
    the lack of reference implementations of these algorithms and the
    variety of accuracy metrics employed.

What nilmtk provides
====================

To address this challenge, we present the Non-intrusive Load Monitoring
Toolkit (NILMTK); an open source toolkit designed specifically to enable
the comparison of energy disaggregation algorithms in a reproducible
manner. This work is the first research to compare multiple
disaggregation approaches across multiple publicly available data sets.
nilmtk includes:

-  parsers for a range of existing data sets (8 and counting)
-  a collection of preprocessing algorithms
-  a set of statistics for describing data sets
-  3 reference benchmark disaggregation algorithms and a suite of
   accuracy metrics
-  a common set of accuracy metrics
-  and much more!
