NILMTK: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring Toolkit
======

Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the process of estimating the energy consumed by individual
appliances given just a whole-house power meter
reading.  In other words, it produces an (estimated) itemised
energy bill from just a single, whole-house power meter.

NILM is sometimes called:

* "non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NALM or NIALM)"
* "[electriciy | energy | smart meter] disaggregation"

Below is an illustration (produced using nilmtk) of what NILM, in general, can do.

N.B. NILMTK has evolved *a lot* since these papers were published! Please use the
[online docs](http://nilmtk.github.io/nilmtk/master/index.html)
as a guide to the current API.

##### Keeping up to date with NILMTK

* [NILMTK-Announce mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nilmtk-announce): stay up to speed with NILMTK.  It will be a fairly low-traffic mailing list.  We'll just announce new versions, new docs etc.
* [NILMTK on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nilmtk).

##### Current state of the project

The project is in its early stages.

Please note that NILMTK is currently a research tool.  It is not yet
ready for use by end-users, although we certainly hope that NILMTK
will be capable of doing 'plug and play' disaggregation in the future.

Please see the docs for more info.

##### Submitting a bug report

Please use our [github issue queue](https://github.com/nilmtk/nilmtk/issues) to submit bug reports, rather than emailing them, which will allow any of us to respond to your issue.  If your bug concerns one of NILMTK's dependencies then please contact the relevant project.

Before opening an issue:

1. Search the issue queue in case a duplicate already exists
2. Pull the latest changes from the repository master branch to see if the error goes away

If not, please open a new issue, ensuring:

1. The title summarises the issue
2. The issue is described in prose
3. A snippet of code is included which will allow us to recreate the bug
4. A copy-paste of the stack produced error
5. Include a copy-paste of the output from nilmtk.utils.show_versions()
